# Crypto Regression Project (Bitcoin)

Built a crypto price prediction tool that uses linear regression to estimate the next price of Bitcoin from the past 30 days of historical market data, pulled via the CoinGecko web API. Implemented data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training in Python (pandas, scikit-learn), and automated outputs in JSON format for integration with other applications.


*I adapted this project from the CoinGecko website. The link can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-price-prediction-ai-model#prerequisites).*

**Summary per GPT:** The CoinGecko project demonstrates a range of practical coding skills. It begins with environment setup and dependency management, showing how to install and manage both Python (with virtual environments) and Node.js/npm packages. It then highlights API integration, where you fetch and parse historical crypto price data from the CoinGecko API, handle JSON responses, and store them in Pandas DataFrames or `.csv` files. The guide also emphasizes data preprocessing and feature engineering, such as timestamp conversion, dataset merging, and creating new variables like lagged prices to prepare the data for modeling. Finally, it walks through building and using a simple linear regression model in Python with scikit-learn, integrating error handling and JSON output to make the script modular and command-line friendly. Overall, it demonstrates core skills in data handling, machine learning basics, and practical coding for real-world AI applications.
